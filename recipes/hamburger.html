        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
            <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
            <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
        </ul>
